  <meta name="description" content="Software succeeds when it satisfies the objectives of its stakeholders. Therefore, stakeholders are the bedrock on which successful software is built. Identifying, understanding, and documenting stakeholders and their objectives is the critical first step in building successful software. When analysts understand who stakeholders are and what they want, they will define better requirements that will result in a better design that will result in secure, reliable, and maintainable software that satisfies stakeholdersâ€™ objectives.">
