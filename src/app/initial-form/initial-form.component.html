                bedrock on which successful software is built. Identifying, understanding, and documenting
                stakeholders and their objectives is the critical first step in building successful software. When analysts
                understand who stakeholders are and what they want, they will define better requirements that will
                result in a better design that will result in secure, reliable, and maintainable software that satisfies
                stakeholdersâ€™ objectives.

            Stakeholder specification tool (SST) makes it faster and easier for analysts to identify, understand, and
            document who stakeholders are and what they want with increased accuracy, consistency, and
            completeness.
